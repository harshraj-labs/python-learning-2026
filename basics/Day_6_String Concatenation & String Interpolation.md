When working with strings, combining different pieces of text together is a common operation.
- In Python, we can combine multiple strings together with the plus (+) operator. This process is called string concatenation.
ex:
```
my_str_1 = 'Hello'
my_str_2 = "World"
str_plus_str = my_str_1 + ' ' + my_str_2
print(str_plus_str) # Hello World
```

- But, If we try to concatenate a string with a number, we'll get a TypeError
- To fix that, we can convert the number into a string with the built-in str() function
```
name = 'John Doe'
age = 26

name_and_age = name + str(age)
print(name_and_age) # John Doe26
```
- We can also use the augmented assignment operator for concatenation. This is represented by a plus and equals sign (+=), and performs both concatenation and assignment in one step.
ex:
```
name = 'John Doe'
age = 26

name_and_age = name  
name_and_age += str(age) 

print(name_and_age)  # John Doe26
```

- The process of inserting variables and expressions into a string is called string interpolation.
- Python has a category of string called f-strings (short for formatted string literals), which allows you to handle interpolation with a compact and readable syntax.
```
name = 'John Doe'
age = 26
name_and_age = f'My name is {name} and I am {age} years old'
print(name_and_age) # My name is John Doe and I am 26 years old
```
